Code for project: 'Machine Learning for Classifying Tremor Using Smartphone Accelerometers and Clinical Features'

#Introduction:
These programs are used to analyze accelerometer recordings from tremor patients (part 1), and then uses unsupervised (part 2) and supervised machine learning techniques (part 3) to either cluster the data or train supervised machine learning classifiers using this data, respectively.

#Requirements:
The following must be installed to run all required programs:
- Python 3.7 or above (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/)
- scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
- matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)

#Part 1:
